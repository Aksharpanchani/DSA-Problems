/*
100317. Peaks in Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/peaks-in-array/

A peak in an array arr is an element that is greater than its previous and next element in arr.

You are given an integer array nums and a 2D integer array queries.

You have to process queries of two types:

queries[i] = [1, li, ri], determine the count of peak elements in the subarray nums[li..ri].
queries[i] = [2, indexi, vali], change nums[indexi] to vali.
Return an array answer containing the results of the queries of the first type in order.
Notes:

The first and the last element of an array or a subarray cannot be a peak.
